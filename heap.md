Sure! Letâ€™s write it out as a **simple textual representation** so itâ€™s easy to **visualize** and **understand**.

## ðŸ§º Everyday meaning:

```
heap
 |
 +-- A messy pile of things
     e.g., a heap of clothes, a heap of books
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ In computer science (data structure):

Imagine numbers arranged like this:

```
   50
  /  \
20    30
/ \
10 15
```

This is a **max-heap**:

* The **biggest number (50)** is always on top.
* Every parent number is **bigger than its children**.

---

Or a **min-heap** might look like:

```
   10
  /  \
20    30
/ \
50  40
```

* The **smallest number (10)** is on top.
* Every parent number is **smaller than its children**.

## ðŸ§  In programming (heap memory):

```
Computer memory
 |
 +-- Stack  (for short-term, fast storage like function calls)
 |
 +-- Heap   (for longer-term, dynamic storage like objects created at runtime)
```

* The **heap** is a place in memory where programs can **dynamically allocate** memory when needed.

If you'd like, I can also draw it as an **ASCII tree** or with even simpler text boxes!
Let me know!
