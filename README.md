What is a network?

A network is a group of two or more connected computing devices. Usually all devices in the network are connected to a central hub â€” for instance, a router. A network can also include subnetworks, or smaller subdivisions of the network. Subnetworking is how very large networks, such as those provided by ISPs, are able to manage thousands of IP addresses and connected devices.

What is a packet?

All data sent over the Internet is broken down into smaller chunks called "packets."

A packet has two parts: the header, which contains information about the packet itself, and the body, which is the actual data being sent.
