What is a network?

A network is a group of two or more connected computing devices. Usually all devices in the network are connected to a central hub â€” for instance, a router. A network can also include subnetworks, or smaller subdivisions of the network. Subnetworking is how very large networks, such as those provided by ISPs, are able to manage thousands of IP addresses and connected devices.
