That’s an excellent question — and the fact you’re asking it means you’re already on the right track.
Because you’ve shown you already have practical exposure (NetApp, Cisco, Brocade, Linux, scripting, web apps, etc.), the next steps depend on **what direction you want to grow**.

Let me outline this in **three practical tracks** — you can mix them based on your interest and career goals:

---

## ✅ **1️⃣ Deepen your core technical depth (mid-to-advanced level)**

> *Goal: Become someone who not only configures, but designs, troubleshoots, and explains why.*

**Storage:**

* NetApp ONTAP advanced topics (MetroCluster, SnapMirror/SnapVault, FabricPool, SVM DR)
* FC SAN design: single-initiator zoning, multipathing, LUN masking, troubleshooting tools (`fcp ping`, Brocade `porterrshow`)
* RAID & WAFL internals (how NetApp handles writes, consistency points)

**Networking:**

* Advanced VLAN design (Private VLANs, VTP pruning)
* Spanning Tree (RSTP, MSTP, troubleshooting loops)
* HSRP, VRRP, GLBP (failover and design decisions)
* Automation: using Python (Netmiko, NAPALM) or Ansible to push configs

**Linux:**

* System performance tuning (`sysctl`, iostat, sar)
* Security: iptables/nftables, SELinux/AppArmor basics
* Scripting: Bash + Python (combine them)

---

## ✅ **2️⃣ Broaden into design, monitoring, and automation**

> *Goal: Become the person who sees the full picture, not just devices.*

* Network diagrams & documentation (Visio, draw\.io)
* Monitoring stack: Zabbix, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* Automation:

  * Python: write scripts to check switch reachability, automate config backups, or run show commands
  * Ansible: deploy configs to multiple switches
* Understanding protocols deeply: TCP handshake, jumbo frames, multicast vs broadcast
* High availability: design with redundancy, single points of failure analysis

---

## ✅ **3️⃣ Learn modern & complementary skills (big advantage)**

> *Goal: Connect classic infrastructure with modern IT.*

* Containers & orchestration basics: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift (even small lab)
* REST APIs: use Python to call APIs from NetApp, Cisco, VMware
* Cloud networking & hybrid designs (AWS VPC, Azure networking, VPN to on-prem)
* Virtualization deeper: vSphere advanced, storage policies, VM encryption

---

## 🛠 **Practical learning style for you (based on your questions):**

✅ Build **lab setups** (EVE-NG, GNS3, NetApp simulators, Cisco virl)
✅ Use **ASCII diagrams** to explain to yourself how traffic flows
✅ Automate: write small scripts for what you do manually
✅ Document every scenario: what, why, how, trade-offs

---

## 🚀 **If you’d like,**

Tell me:

* Your current role & what your company uses most
* Where you want to be in 1–2 years (network architect? storage engineer? automation engineer? cloud engineer?)
* Your preferred style: hands-on, study books, watch videos, build labs

Then **I can build you a custom “learning roadmap”** with topics, tools, and practical projects to work on.
