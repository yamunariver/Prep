Great! Since you specifically work with **Cisco network switches**, here’s a **focused list of lesser-known but *very useful* things, tools, and troubleshooting tips** tailored for Cisco environments — especially valuable when you're working hands-on in operations, troubleshooting, or even doing changes.

These go beyond just `show running-config` and `show interface` — some are *hidden gems* even experienced engineers sometimes overlook:

---

## 🧰 **1. Interface counters tell stories**

* `show interface X counters errors`
  → Look for **input errors, CRC, frame, runts, giants**: often point to cabling, duplex mismatch, or bad optics.
* `show interface X | i rate`
  → Instant view of input/output rate; great for spotting spikes or sudden drops.

---

## 🧠 **2. Check for flaps and history**

* `show interfaces status err-disabled`
  → Shows which ports are disabled automatically (e.g., BPDU Guard, port-security).
* `show log | i LINEPROTO`
  → Find ports that flap (up/down frequently).
* `show interfaces counters last clear`
  → See when counters were last cleared.

---

## 🔍 **3. CDP / LLDP – know your neighbors**

* `show cdp neighbors detail`
  → Learn directly-connected devices, their IP, platform, software version, interface.
* Enable LLDP (`lldp run`) to see non-Cisco devices: `show lldp neighbors detail`.

---

## 🛣 **4. Trace route within the switch**

* `traceroute` command from the switch CLI helps see Layer 3 paths.

---

## 📦 **5. MAC address table is your friend**

* `show mac address-table dynamic vlan X`
  → Find which port has which MAC.
* `show mac address-table address aaaa.bbbb.cccc`
  → Trace where a client is plugged in.

---

## 📚 **6. Understand VLAN and trunking**

* `show vlan brief` → Which ports are in which VLAN.
* `show interfaces trunk` → Which ports are actually trunking, and which VLANs are allowed.

---

## 🔒 **7. Port security (often overlooked)**

* `show port-security interface X` → See violations, configured limits, and learned MACs.
* Troubleshooting sticky MAC issues: remember sticky MACs stay until removed.

---

## ⚡ **8. Spanning Tree insight**

* `show spanning-tree vlan X`
  → See root port, root bridge ID, cost, port states.
* `show spanning-tree summary`
  → Quick view: blocked, forwarding, listening ports.
* Helps find loops or blocked links.

---

## 🧪 **9. Test cables directly**

* On newer switches: `test cable-diagnostics tdr interface X`
* After a few seconds: `show cable-diagnostics tdr interface X`
  → Find cable faults, length, open/short detection.

---

## 📊 **10. CPU & process monitoring**

* `show processes cpu sorted`
* `show processes memory sorted`
  → Helps when the switch is slow; sometimes an SNMP walk or a process is spiking CPU.

---

## 📦 **11. Check TCAM / hardware table usage**

* `show platform tcam utilization`
* `show system resources`
  → When adding ACLs, many forget the switch has limited TCAM space.

---

## 🧰 **12. NetFlow / SPAN for deeper troubleshooting**

* SPAN (port mirroring): `monitor session 1 source interface X`, `monitor session 1 destination interface Y`
  → Capture traffic in Wireshark for detailed analysis.
* NetFlow (if supported): analyze flow data over time.

---

## 🏷 **13. EtherChannel & load balancing**

* `show etherchannel summary`
* `show etherchannel port-channel`
  → Understand which physical links are active and how traffic is distributed.

---

## 🧩 **14. Logs & Syslog**

* `show logging`
  → But better to send logs to a **Syslog server** for history and search.

---

## 📄 **15. Config best practices**

* Use `archive` feature:

  ```
  archive
   path flash:backup-$h-$t
   write-memory
  ```

→ Keeps backups of config after every `write memory`.

* Use `description` on every interface. Future you (and your teammates) will thank you.

## ⚙️ **16. Hidden but powerful commands**

| What             | Command                         | Why useful                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Detailed IP info | `show ip interface brief`       | Status of all interfaces             |
| ACL hit counts   | `show access-lists`             | Shows which ACEs are matching        |
| DHCP snooping    | `show ip dhcp snooping binding` | Find which IP is on which port       |
| Check NTP        | `show ntp status`               | Time sync issues cause log confusion |

---

## 🧩 **17. Practical mindset for Cisco switch troubleshooting**

✅ Always:

* Check physical first (cable, LEDs).
* Look for **duplex & speed mismatches**: `show interfaces status`.
* Confirm VLAN membership & trunking.
* Use `ping` & `traceroute` directly from the switch.
* Correlate with logs: when did it start?

---

If you'd like, tell me:
✅ Exact Cisco models you use (2960, 9200, etc.)
✅ Typical tasks: do you do design, config, monitoring, or mostly troubleshooting?

I can then write you a **tailored cheat sheet** or even a **Python script / tool** to automate some checks (e.g., auto collect `show` commands and parse them).

Want me to do that? 🚀




Perfect — that means you already have a **solid foundation**!
Since you know most of the usual and even many advanced Cisco CLI commands, let’s go **deeper into lesser-known, “ninja-level” networking & troubleshooting ideas** that even many experienced admins don’t fully use — and that can really boost your troubleshooting and design skills.

These will be a mix of advanced **Cisco**, **network theory**, and **troubleshooting mindsets/tools**:

---

## 🧠 **1. Control Plane vs Data Plane troubleshooting**

* Many issues don’t come from broken ports, but from CPU being busy:

  * Control plane handles STP, routing protocols, CDP/LLDP.
  * Data plane forwards packets at line rate.
* Check with:

  ```
  show processes cpu sorted
  show platform cpu packet statistics
  ```
* High CPU in control plane → routing, spanning tree flaps, or even malicious scanning.

---

## 🔍 **2. Identify CAM table overflow (MAC flooding)**

* Intentional or accidental flooding can make switches act weird.
* Use:

  ```
  show mac address-table count
  ```
* If you see way more MACs than expected, it could be flooding.

---

## 📦 **3. Understand Unicast Flooding**

* Happens when switch loses track of where a MAC is.
* Fix: check aging timer (`show mac address-table aging-time`), and see if the MAC is moving ports rapidly.

---

## 🌐 **4. IP SLA & track**

* Many forget Cisco can do active testing:

  * `ip sla 1`

    ```
    icmp-echo 8.8.8.8
    frequency 10
    ```
  * `track 1 ip sla 1 reachability`
* Then use `track` to influence routing if the target is down.
* Helps auto-react to WAN failures.

---

## 🛡 **5. Control Plane Policing (CoPP)**

* Prevents rogue traffic from overwhelming CPU.
* Not just for security: helps keep control protocols stable.

---

## 🧪 **6. Embedded Event Manager (EEM) scripts**

* Automate reaction to events:

  * E.g., send an email if interface flaps.
* Example:

  ```
  event manager applet Watch_Interface
   event syslog pattern "Interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1, changed state to down"
   action 1.0 syslog msg "Alert: Port Gi1/0/1 went down"
  ```
* Saves manual monitoring.

---

## 🔄 **7. Using `show platform` and hardware-level info**

* Newer switches: `show platform hardware port`
* Check ASIC counters to detect if the hardware is dropping packets (vs. software drops).

---

## 🧰 **8. IP accounting / NetFlow / Flexible NetFlow**

* Go beyond “is it up?” to “what’s talking to what, and how much?”
* Use:

  ```
  show ip cache flow
  ```

  or

  ```
  show flow monitor NAME cache
  ```

---

## 🧩 **9. Know the difference: Storm-control vs. Port-security**

* Storm-control → limits broadcast, multicast, unknown unicast.
* Port-security → limits learned MACs.
* Both help stabilize network if something noisy is plugged in.

---

## 🧠 **10. Asymmetric routing with multiple VLANs**

* Traffic comes in on VLAN A, reply goes out VLAN B.
* Many tools miss this because pings look fine but real traffic fails.
* Use packet captures on multiple points to confirm.

---

## 🧊 **11. Deep Spanning Tree insight**

* `show spanning-tree detail | include from`
  → Shows why port is blocking.
* Check Bridge IDs and path cost to see why a switch is not the root.

---

## 🔧 **12. Troubleshoot TCAM usage**

* ACLs, QoS, and VLANs all consume TCAM.
* `show platform tcam utilization`
* Adding an ACL might unexpectedly disable other features if TCAM is full.

---

## 📜 **13. Collecting baseline snapshots**

* Regularly run and store:

  ```
  show tech-support
  show running-config
  show version
  show interface status
  show spanning-tree summary
  ```
* Compare over time to spot slow changes (duplex change, new VLAN, etc.)

---

## 🐍 **14. Automate health checks (Python/Netmiko/NAPALM)**

* Script to SSH into switches and:

  * Collect `show` outputs.
  * Parse errors/drops.
  * Compare running config vs. template.
* Saves time and makes changes traceable.

---

## 🧪 **15. Test edge cases**

* Jumbo frames / MTU.
* HSRP preemption & delay.
* VRRP vs. HSRP vs. GLBP: subtle differences.
* What happens if the root switch goes down?

---

## ⚡ **16. Power over Ethernet (PoE)**

* `show power inline`
* Some phones/cameras may not come up if budget is exceeded.

---

## 🧩 **17. Understand ARP cache issues**

* `show ip arp`
* Missing ARP → cannot forward; excessive ARP → CPU stress.

---

## 📚 **18. Build mental models**

* Keep an updated **logical diagram** + **Layer 2 diagram**.
* When something breaks, trace the path:

  * Device → Switch → VLAN → Trunk → Router → Internet.

---

## 🧰 **19. Track weird stuff**

* `show interface counters errors` → CRC, collisions, late collisions.
* `show interface queue` → see if queues are dropping packets.

---

## 🧠 **20. Always ask: “What changed?”**

* 80% of network issues come right after:

  * Adding/removing VLANs.
  * Changing spanning tree root.
  * Upgrading firmware.
