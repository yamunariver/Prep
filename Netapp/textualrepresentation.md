Sure! Here’s a clear **textual representation** describing how the different components like NetApp ONTAP controllers, Fibre Channel (FC) switches, bridges, and servers are typically connected in a storage network (SAN).

I’ll use an **ASCII-like outline** to make it easier to visualize:

   (Servers connect to both FC switches for high availability)

```

**Explanation (in words):**
✅ The NetApp system runs ONTAP, typically in a high-availability pair: Controller A and Controller B.
✅ Each controller has multiple Fibre Channel (FC) ports.
✅ FC ports connect to **two redundant FC switches** (Switch A & Switch B), ensuring no single point of failure.
✅ The switches also connect to **FC-to-SAS bridges**, which in turn connect to **SAS disk shelves** to store data.
✅ Application or database servers connect to the same FC switches via dual-port HBAs (Host Bus Adapters). This enables multipathing, so that if one path or switch fails, the data is still reachable through the other path.

This design ensures **high availability and redundancy** at every layer: controllers, switches, bridges, and host connections.

If you'd like, I can also draw:

* a **more detailed diagram**,
* a **simplified version** for presentations, or
* add **iSCSI or NVMe** paths if you’re using those too.

Just let me know!
