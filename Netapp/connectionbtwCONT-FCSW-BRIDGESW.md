Perfect‚Äîthank you for clarifying!
Let‚Äôs do this **practically** and show what config is actually needed **between them**:

‚ö† **Important:**

* *IP routers & switches* are configured using IP addresses, routing protocols, VLANs, etc.
* *FC switches & FC-to-SAS bridges* do **not** use IP addresses between them (only FC WWNs, zoning, etc.).
* FC and IP networks are **separate**; they don‚Äôt connect *directly*.
* You do *not* configure an IP router to talk to an FC switch or FC-to-SAS bridge directly.

---

## ‚úÖ **Typical config in a real environment**

### Scenario

You have:

* Two NetApp controllers running ONTAP
* Two FC switches (Brocade / Cisco MDS)
* Two FC-to-SAS bridges (e.g., ATTO FibreBridge 7500N)
* Servers (maybe with dual-port FC HBAs)

---

## üì¶ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure NetApp FC ports (ONTAP)**

NetApp controllers have FC ports used to connect to FC switches.
Usually in *target* mode.

Example in ONTAP CLI:

```bash
# Show FC adapters
network fcp adapter show

# Enable FC service on vserver
vserver fcp create -vserver vs1 -status-admin up

# Show status
vserver fcp show
```

---

## üõ† **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure FC switches (e.g., Brocade or Cisco MDS)**

Purpose:

* Connect FC ports from NetApp controllers and FC-to-SAS bridges.
* Do zoning so the controllers can "see" the shelves through the bridges.

**Example Brocade CLI:**

```bash
# Create aliases for WWPNs
alicreate "netapp_ctrla_fc1", "20:00:00:25:b5:11:22:33"
alicreate "bridge1_fc1", "21:00:00:1b:32:44:55:66"

# Create zones: single initiator zoning
zonecreate "zone_ctrla_bridge1", "netapp_ctrla_fc1;bridge1_fc1"

# Add zone to config
cfgcreate "netapp_config", "zone_ctrla_bridge1"
# or add to existing config
cfgadd "netapp_config", "zone_ctrla_bridge1"

# Enable config
cfgenable "netapp_config"
```

Repeat for other controller ports, FC switches and bridges.

---

## üîå **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure FC-to-SAS bridge (e.g., ATTO FibreBridge 7500N)**

Connect via serial or SSH.

**Example config:**

```bash
# Name the bridge
set bridgename="FB7500N_01"

# Set FC port speed & topology
set fcport0 speed=Auto
set fcport0 topology=Auto

# Enable N_Port ID mode
set fcport0 nportidmode=Enabled

# (Optional) set IP for management
set ipaddress=192.168.100.10
set ipsubnetmask=255.255.255.0
set ipgateway=192.168.100.1

# Save config
saveconfiguration

# Reboot if needed
reset
```

The bridge doesn‚Äôt need config to "talk" to the FC switch:

* It plugs into the FC switch.
* Switch zoning tells what devices can see each other.

---

## ‚úÖ **4Ô∏è‚É£ How they "talk":**

* NetApp FC ports ‚Üí FC switches ‚Üí FC-to-SAS bridges ‚Üí SAS shelves
* No IP between FC switch & bridge.
* Management IP only to manage the bridge.

---

## üìë **If you add IP routers:**

They would only be used to:

* Manage the FC switches (via SSH/telnet)
* Manage the bridges (via SSH/telnet)
* Manage NetApp controllers (via ONTAP System Manager / SSH)

But **they do not carry FC traffic**.

---

## üß∞ **Summary Table:**

| What      | Config                       | Notes                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| NetApp FC | Enable FC ports, set target  | Connect to FC switches                        |
| FC switch | Zoning                       | Decide which devices can see each other       |
| Bridge    | FC port speed, WWPN, mgmt IP | Connect FC port to switch; SAS ports to shelf |
| Router    | IP only                      | Used only for management; not for FC traffic  |

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**

You don‚Äôt configure a "link" between router & FC switch.
You configure:

* NetApp FC ports to connect to FC switch.
* Zoning on FC switch to allow NetApp ‚Üí bridge.
* FC-to-SAS bridge to plug into switch & shelves.
  Routers are only for IP management, not for FC storage data.
