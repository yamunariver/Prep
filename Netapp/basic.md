Absolutely — great question!
Since you’re hands‑on with **NetApp + FC SAN + VMware / servers**, here’s a **practical list of what you *should* understand** to be confident and avoid surprises.
This is what most storage & SAN engineers keep in mind:

---

## ✅ **1️⃣ What is a WWPN and why it matters**

* WWPN = *World Wide Port Name* — unique address burned into each FC port (like a MAC address for Fibre Channel).
* Used by the **SAN fabric** (FC switch) to identify *initiators* (hosts/HBAs) and *targets* (NetApp FC ports).
* Zoning, masking, and monitoring all use WWPNs.

---

## ✅ **2️⃣ Zoning (on FC switches)**

* Controls **which initiator can see which target**.
* Best practice: *Single initiator zoning*:

  ```
  one host HBA WWPN ↔ multiple storage target WWPNs
  ```
* Keeps fabric secure, predictable, and easier to troubleshoot.

---

## ✅ **3️⃣ LUN masking (on NetApp)**

* After zoning allows connectivity, NetApp must still **map the LUN** to an *igroup* (which is a list of initiator WWPNs).
* Without mapping: even though the server can "see" the storage port, it won’t see the LUN.

---

## ✅ **4️⃣ Multi-pathing**

* Servers usually have **dual-port HBA** (two WWPNs) → redundancy.
* NetApp controllers have multiple FC ports.
* Together → multiple paths → requires **multipath driver/software** (e.g., VMware Native Multipath, MPIO on Windows).
* Avoid single points of failure.

---

## ✅ **5️⃣ NetApp controllers WWPNs**

* Each physical FC target port has a unique WWPN.
* Different ports on same controller → different WWPNs.
* Important when creating zones and igroups.

---

## ✅ **6️⃣ SnapMirror destination LUNs are read-only**

* You can't use them for live writes on production.
* If you *mount them* to a server, you’ll see the LUN but it might go offline during SnapMirror updates.

---

## ✅ **7️⃣ NPIV (N\_Port ID Virtualization)**

* Special case: lets each VM get its own virtual WWPN.
* Requires:

  * FC switch support
  * HBA support
  * Configuration in VMware vSphere
* Useful if you want to present different LUNs to different VMs directly.

---

## ✅ **8️⃣ Monitoring & troubleshooting**

* Commands to check who is logged in:

  ```bash
  # Brocade
  switchshow
  nsshow
  portshow
  ```
* NetApp to check LUNs, mappings, igroups:

  ```bash
  lun show
  lun mapping show
  ```
* NetApp to check SnapMirror:

  ```bash
  snapmirror show
  ```

---

## ✅ **9️⃣ Understanding what you see on switch**

When you plug a server HBA to a switch port:

* You should see:

  ```
  Port: Online
  Attached Node Name / Port Name → the server HBA’s WWNN & WWPN
  ```
* If not: check cables, SFPs, HBA config, driver.

---

## 🧠 **10️⃣ Data flow (big picture):**

```
[ VM ] → [ ESXi ] → [ ESXi HBA WWPN ] → [ FC Switch ] → [ NetApp controller FC port WWPN ] → [ LUN in NetApp ]
```
